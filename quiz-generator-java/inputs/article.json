    "body": "<p>Many people assume systems (such as those in the U.S.) originate and evolve because a group of thinkers designed them and then reshaped them according to their plans. Others think rich elites design and modify them to rig the rules in their favor. Still others imagine history as steady, linear progress, where ideas emerge and improve through the accumulation of knowledge, evidence, and better policies. <em>Yet history rarely moves so neatly</em>. In reality, change is driven by tension and conflict between competing ideas. Old ideas collide with new realities, systems buckle under the pressure of their own assumptions, and from that friction something new takes shape. This pattern of transformation is what philosophers call the <strong>dialectic process</strong>.</p><p>Think about how <em>communism</em> collided with <em>early industrial-capitalism</em> to produce <em>welfare capitalism</em> due to the tensions created by the exploitative working conditions of the early industrial capitalism, class inequality and labor alienation. Nobody deliberately designed this <em>welfare capitalism</em> from the outset, but it emerged from a struggle between two diametrically opposite ideologies.</p><h3>What Is a Dialectic?</h3><p>The dialectic process describes how an existing idea, system, or social order generates its own opposition as contradictions, tensions, and conflicts emerge. Those contradictions create counter-movements that challenge the dominant order, and the struggle between the two produces a new arrangement that absorbs elements of both. In medieval Europe, for example, the Catholic Church’s central authority produced tensions through corruption and coercion, which helped generate reform movements that reshaped Christianity and the political order.</p><p>In its simplest form, it is often summarized as:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Thesis</strong>: a dominant idea, worldview, or institutional arrangement</p></li><li><p><strong>Antithesis</strong>: a counter-force that exposes contradictions within the <em>thesis</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Synthesis</strong>: a new formation that resolves the tension while preserving elements of both</p></li></ul><p>This is akin to two gushing streams of water colliding to produce a stable stream (a synthesis), and the process continues.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img can-restack\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TtfC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a23718-3092-4bd2-8f64-3d3ac8441b6d_1536x1024.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TtfC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0a23718-3092-4bd2-8f64-3d3ac8441b6d_1536x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1456\" height=\"971\"></a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://mineglobal.substack.com/p/how-systems-come-into-existence-the?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNTc0NzE0NDIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE4NDE3Mjk3MywiaWF0IjoxNzY4MzE2MTI1LCJleHAiOjE3NzA5MDgxMjUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0yNzI2NDIyIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.e8gtGlBhhLNsSYUVRKet9_m5vR5sDSmW9_D90A8NJA8\">Share</a></p><p>This is not a fixed formula, but a way to see change instead of stability.

For <em>Hegel</em>, ideas are not static truths but living processes. Every concept contains internal tensions that push it beyond itself. Freedom, authority, morality, and even self-consciousness in a society develop through struggle, not harmony.</p><p>Later, <em>Karl Marx</em> transformed this framework by grounding it in material conditions rather than pure ideas. Where <em>Hegel</em> saw the dialectic unfolding in <em>consciousness</em>, <em>Marx</em> located it in <em>economic relations</em> and <em>class conflict</em>. Capitalism, in Marx’s view, generates immense productivity while simultaneously producing inequality and alienation. These contradictions intensify tensions within the existing mode of production and, through class struggle, drive a transition to a new mode of production, which Marx believed could unfold through successive historical stages and ultimately culminate in a communist world order.</p><p>Despite their differences, both thinkers shared a crucial insight: contradiction is not a flaw in a system; it is the engine of its evolution.</p><h3>Dialectics in Real-World Systems</h3><p>Dialectical processes are not confined to philosophy. They are visible across economics, politics, and social life.</p><p>An interesting example comes from the political influence of <strong>AIPAC</strong> in U.S. politics, which can be understood as a dominant thesis that institutionalizes unconditional support for Israel. However, over time, this dominance has generated internal contradictions within U.S. political circles, particularly around concerns about human rights violations and the marginalization of the Palestinian population. These tensions have given rise to an emerging antithesis within the liberal left that challenges donor-driven influence and demands moral consistency. It has also generated an antithesis on the conservative right. Any synthesis is unlikely to abolish lobbying altogether in the near term, but may instead recalibrate the boundaries of U.S. unconditional support for Israel.</p><p>In economics, consider the recurring tension between <strong>market freedom and regulation</strong>. Unregulated markets often produce growth and innovation, but they also generate instability and inequality. Regulation emerges as an antithesis, correcting excesses but sometimes stifling dynamism. The modern mixed economy is a synthesis, never final, always contested.</p><p>In politics, the tension between <strong>state authority and civil society</strong> is deeply dialectical. Too much state power leads to despotism; too little leads to fragmentation. Stability emerges only when both sides remain strong and constrained by each other. This balance is not permanent. It must be continually renegotiated.</p><h3>Why Dialectical Thinking Matters Today</h3><p>Dialectical thinking pushes us to critique existing worldviews with the expectation of <em>refinement</em> rather than <em>total replacement</em>. If people aim for total replacement, they set themselves up for disappointment because total replacement in a dialectical struggle is rare.</p><p>In addition, the resulting <em>synthesis</em> is shaped by the <strong>relative strength</strong> of the <em>thesis</em> and the <em>antithesis</em>. If the <em>thesis</em> is much more powerful than the <em>antithesis</em>, the status quo will change only slightly. However, if the system is to be modified in a major way (producing a markedly different status quo), the <em>antithesis</em> must be strong. This means that people who intend to change a system in a meaningful way (that is, to generate a new synthesis) need to be strongly empowered.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img can-restack\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g3f4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58e1a62d-be0b-4d3b-acad-b1d6021b9fd5_1024x1536.webp\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g3f4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58e1a62d-be0b-4d3b-acad-b1d6021b9fd5_1024x1536.webp\" alt=\"Generated image\" title=\"Generated image\" width=\"428\" height=\"642\"></a></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\" class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://mineglobal.substack.com/p/how-systems-come-into-existence-the?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNTc0NzE0NDIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE4NDE3Mjk3MywiaWF0IjoxNzY4MzE2MTI1LCJleHAiOjE3NzA5MDgxMjUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0yNzI2NDIyIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.e8gtGlBhhLNsSYUVRKet9_m5vR5sDSmW9_D90A8NJA8\">Share</a></p><p></p><p>Dialectical thinking also offers an antidote to two common intellectual failures.</p><p>The first is <strong>utopianism</strong>. This is the belief that a single correct idea, once implemented, will dissolve conflict. Utopian thinking ignores the fact that every solution generates new contradictions. <em>Thinkers committed to a worldview must be able to integrate real-world constraints into their moral and ontological framework if they want their ideals to produce meaningful change.</em></p><p>The second is <strong>fatalism</strong>. This is the belief that systems and power structures are preordained (through fate) and it is hopeless to make a change. Fatalism overlooks the internal stresses that eventually force transformation.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The dialectic process reminds us that history is not a straight line and progress is not a clean story. Change emerges through tension, contradiction, and negotiation. Ideas do not simply replace one another; they collide, merge, and mutate.</p><p>Dialectics helps us think about what is possible. It trains us to focus on processes, not fixed positions. In an age of polarization and shallow certainty, this kind of thinking is highly necessary.</p>",
